      <h2>1. The Opening</h2>
      <p>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.</p>
      <p>All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
      <p>The Beneficent, the Merciful.</p>
      <p>Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
      <p>Thee do we serve and Thee do we beseech for help.</p>
      <p>Keep us on the right path.</p>
      <p>The path of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed favors. Not (the path) of those upon
         whom Thy wrath is brought down, nor of those who go astray.
