      <h1>72. The Jinn</h1>
      <h2>72. The Jinn</h2>
      <p>Say: It has been revealed to me that a party of the jinn listened, and they said:
         Surely we have heard a wonderful Quran,
      </p>
      <p>Guiding to the right way, so we believe in it, and we will not set up any one with
         our Lord:
      </p>
      <p>And that He — exalted be the majesty of our Lord — has not taken a consort, nor a
         son:
      </p>
      <p>And that the foolish amongst us used to forge extravagant things against Allah:</p>
      <p>And that we thought that men and jinn did not utter a lie against Allah:</p>
      <p>And that persons from among men used to seek refuge with persons from among jinn,
         so they increased them in wrongdoing:
      </p>
      <p>And that they thought as you think, that Allah would not raise anyone:</p>
      <p>And that we sought to reach heaven, but we found it filled with strong guards and
         flaming stars.
      </p>
      <p>And that we used to sit in some of the sitting-places thereof to steal a hearing,
         but he who would (try to) listen now would find a flame lying in wait for him:
      </p>
      <p>And that we know not whether evil is meant for those who are on earth or whether their
         Lord means to bring them good:
      </p>
      <p>And that some of us are good and others of us are below that: we are sects following
         different ways:
      </p>
      <p>And that we know that we cannot escape Allah in the earth, nor can we escape Him by
         flight:
      </p>
      <p>And that when we heard the guidance, we believed in it; so whoever believes in his
         Lord, he should neither fear loss nor being overtaken (by disgrace):
      </p>
      <p>And that some of us are those who submit, and some of us are the deviators; so whoever
         submits, these aim at the right way:
      </p>
      <p>And as to the deviators, they are fuel of hell:</p>
      <p>And that if they should keep to the (right) way, We would certainly give them to drink
         of abundant water,
      </p>
      <p>So that We might try them with respect to it; and whoever turns aside from the reminder
         of his Lord, He will make him enter into an afflicting chastisement:
      </p>
      <p>And that the mosques are Allah's, therefore call not upon any one with Allah:</p>
      <p>And that when the servant of Allah stood up calling upon Him, they wellnigh crowded
         him (to death).
      </p>
      <p>Say: I only call upon my Lord, and I do not associate any one with Him.</p>
      <p>Say: I do not control for you evil or good.</p>
      <p>Say: Surely no one can protect me against Allah, nor can I find besides Him any place
         of refuge:
      </p>
      <p>(It is) only a delivering (of communications) from Allah and His messages; and whoever
         disobeys Allah and His Apostle surely he shall have the fire of hell to abide therein
         for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>Until when they see what they are threatened with, then shall they know who is weaker
         in helpers and fewer in number.
      </p>
      <p>Say: I do not know whether that with which you are threatened be nigh or whether my
         Lord will appoint for it a term:
      </p>
      <p>The Knower of the unseen! so He does not reveal His secrets to any,</p>
      <p>Except to him whom He chooses as an apostle; for surely He makes a guard to march
         before him and after him,
      </p>
      <p>So that He may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their Lord, and
         He encompasses what is with them and He records the number of all things.
