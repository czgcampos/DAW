      <h2>106. The Qureaish</h2>
      <p>For the protection of the Qureaish — </p>
      <p>Their protection during their trading caravans in the winter and the summer — </p>
      <p>So let them serve the Lord of this House,</p>
      <p>Who feeds them against hunger and gives them security against fear.</p>
