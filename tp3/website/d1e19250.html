      <h1>80. He Frowned</h1>
      <h2>80. He Frowned</h2>
      <p>He frowned and turned (his) back,</p>
      <p>Because there came to him the blind man.</p>
      <p>And what would make you know that he would purify himself,</p>
      <p>Or become reminded so that the reminder should profit him?</p>
      <p>As for him who considers himself free from need (of you),</p>
      <p>To him do you address yourself.</p>
      <p>And no blame is on you if he would not purify himself.</p>
      <p>And as to him who comes to you striving hard,</p>
      <p>And he fears,</p>
      <p>From him will you divert yourself.</p>
      <p>Nay! surely it is an admonishment.</p>
      <p>So let him who pleases mind it.</p>
      <p>In honored books,</p>
      <p>Exalted, purified,</p>
      <p>In the hands of scribes,</p>
      <p>Noble, virtuous.</p>
      <p>Cursed be man! how ungrateful is he!</p>
      <p>Of what thing did He create him?</p>
      <p>Of a small seed; He created him, then He made him according to a measure,</p>
      <p>Then (as for) the way — He has made it easy (for him)</p>
      <p>Then He causes him to die, then assigns to him a grave,</p>
      <p>Then when He pleases, He will raise him to life again.</p>
      <p>Nay; but he has not done what He bade him.</p>
      <p>Then let man look to his food,</p>
      <p>That We pour down the water, pouring (it) down in abundance,</p>
      <p>Then We cleave the earth, cleaving (it) asunder,</p>
      <p>Then We cause to grow therein the grain,</p>
      <p>And grapes and clover,</p>
      <p>And the olive and the palm,</p>
      <p>And thick gardens,</p>
      <p>And fruits and herbage,</p>
      <p>A provision for you and for your cattle.</p>
      <p>But when the deafening cry comes,</p>
      <p>The day on which a man shall fly from his brother,</p>
      <p>And his mother and his father,</p>
      <p>And his spouse and his son — </p>
      <p>Every man of them shall on that day have an affair which will occupy him.</p>
      <p>(Many) faces on that day shall be bright,</p>
      <p>Laughing, joyous.</p>
      <p>And (many) faces on that day, on them shall be dust,</p>
      <p>Darkness shall cover them.</p>
      <p>These are they who are unbelievers, the wicked.</p>
