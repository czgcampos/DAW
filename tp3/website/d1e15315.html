      <h1>50. Qaf</h1>
      <h2>50. Qaf</h2>
      <p>Qaf. I swear by the glorious Quran (that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.)</p>
      <p>Nay! they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, so the
         unbelievers say: This is a wonderful thing:
      </p>
      <p>What! when we are dead and have become dust? That is afar (from probable) return.</p>
      <p>We know indeed what the earth diminishes of them, and with Us is a writing that preserves.</p>
      <p>Nay, they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are (now) in a state of
         confusion.
      </p>
      <p>Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have made it and adorned it and
         it has no gaps?
      </p>
      <p>And the earth, We have made it plain and cast in it mountains and We have made to
         grow therein of all beautiful kinds,
      </p>
      <p>To give sight and as a reminder to every servant who turns frequently (to Allah).</p>
      <p>And We send down from the cloud water abounding in good, then We cause to grow thereby
         gardens and the grain that is reaped,
      </p>
      <p>And the tall palm-trees having spadices closely set one above another,</p>
      <p>A sustenance for the servants, and We give life thereby to a dead land; thus is the
         rising.
      </p>
      <p>(Others) before them rejected (prophets): the people of Nuh and the dwellers of Ar-Rass
         and Samood,
      </p>
      <p>And Ad and Firon and Lut's brethren,</p>
      <p>And the dwellers of the grove and the people of Tuba; all rejected the apostles, so
         My threat came to pass.
      </p>
      <p>Were We then fatigued with the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard to
         a new creation.
      </p>
      <p>And certainly We created man, and We know what his mind suggests to him, and We are
         nearer to him than his life-vein.
      </p>
      <p>When the two receivers receive, sitting on the right and on the left.</p>
      <p>He utters not a word but there is by him a watcher at hand.</p>
      <p>And the stupor of death will come in truth; that is what you were trying to escape.</p>
      <p>And the trumpet shall be blown; that is the day of the threatening.</p>
      <p>And every soul shall come, with it a driver and a witness.</p>
      <p>Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, so
         your sight today is sharp.
      </p>
      <p>And his companions shall say: This is what is ready with me.</p>
      <p>Do cast into hell every ungrateful, rebellious one,</p>
      <p>Forbidder of good, exceeder of limits, doubter,</p>
      <p>Who sets up another god with Allah, so do cast him into severe chastisement.</p>
      <p>His companion will say: Our Lord! I did not lead him into inordinacy but he himself
         was in a great error.
      </p>
      <p>He will say: Do not quarrel in My presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening
         beforehand:
      </p>
      <p>My word shall not be changed, nor am I in the least unjust to the servants.</p>
      <p>On the day that We will say to hell: Are you filled up? And it will say: Are there
         any more?
      </p>
      <p>And the garden shall be brought near to those who guard (against evil), not far off:</p>
      <p>This is what you were promised, (it is) for every one who turns frequently (to Allah),
         keeps (His limits);
      </p>
      <p>Who fears the Beneficent God in secret and comes with a penitent heart:</p>
      <p>Enter it in peace, that is the day of abiding.</p>
      <p>They have therein what they wish and with Us is more yet.</p>
      <p>And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess
         than they, so they went about and about in the lands. Is there a place of refuge?
      </p>
      <p>Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and
         is a witness.
      </p>
      <p>And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six
         periods and there touched Us not any fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore be patient of what they say, and sing the praise of your Lord before the
         rising of the sun and before the setting.
      </p>
      <p>And glorify Him in the night and after the prayers.</p>
      <p>And listen on the day when the crier shall cry from a near place,</p>
      <p>The day when they shall hear the cry in truth; that is the day of coming forth.</p>
      <p>Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the eventual coming;</p>
      <p>The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them, they will make haste;
         that is a gathering together easy to Us.
      </p>
      <p>We know best what they say, and you are not one to compel them; therefore remind him
         by means of the Quran who fears My threat.
