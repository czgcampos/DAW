      <h1>84. The Bursting Asunder</h1>
      <h2>84. The Bursting Asunder</h2>
      <p>When the heaven bursts asunder,</p>
      <p>And obeys its Lord and it must.</p>
      <p>And when the earth is stretched,</p>
      <p>And casts forth what is in it and becomes empty,</p>
      <p>And obeys its Lord and it must.</p>
      <p>O man! surely you must strive (to attain) to your Lord, a hard striving until you
         meet Him.
      </p>
      <p>Then as to him who is given his book in his right hand,</p>
      <p>He shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning,</p>
      <p>And he shall go back to his people joyful.</p>
      <p>And as to him who is given his book behind his back,</p>
      <p>He shall call for perdition,</p>
      <p>And enter into burning fire.</p>
      <p>Surely he was (erstwhile) joyful among his followers.</p>
      <p>Surely he thought that he would never return.</p>
      <p>Yea! surely his Lord does ever see him.</p>
      <p>But nay! I swear by the sunset redness,</p>
      <p>And the night and that which it drives on,</p>
      <p>And the moon when it grows full,</p>
      <p>That you shall most certainly enter one state after another.</p>
      <p>But what is the matter with them that they do not believe,</p>
      <p>And when the Quran is recited to them they do not make obeisance?</p>
      <p>Nay! those who disbelieve give the lie to the truth.</p>
      <p>And Allah knows best what they hide,</p>
      <p>So announce to them a painful punishment,</p>
      <p>Except those who believe and do good; for them is a reward that shall never be cut
         off.
