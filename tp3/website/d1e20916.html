      <h2>105. The Elephant</h2>
      <p>Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the possessors of the elephant?</p>
      <p>Did He not cause their war to end in confusion,</p>
      <p>And send down (to prey) upon them birds in flocks,</p>
      <p>Casting against them stones of baked clay,</p>
      <p>So He rendered them like straw eaten up?</p>
