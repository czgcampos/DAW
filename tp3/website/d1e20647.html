      <h2>98. The Clear Evidence</h2>
      <p>Those who disbelieved from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists could
         not have separated (from the faithful) until there had come to them the clear evidence:
      </p>
      <p>An apostle from Allah, reciting pure pages,</p>
      <p>Wherein are all the right ordinances.</p>
      <p>And those who were given the Book did not become divided except after clear evidence
         had come to them.
      </p>
      <p>And they were not enjoined anything except that they should serve Allah, being sincere
         to Him in obedience, upright, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and that is
         the right religion.
      </p>
      <p>Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists
         shall be in the fire of hell, abiding therein; they are the worst of men.
      </p>
      <p>(As for) those who believe and do good, surely they are the -best of men.</p>
      <p>Their reward with their Lord is gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, abiding
         therein for ever; Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him;
         that is for him who fears his Lord.
