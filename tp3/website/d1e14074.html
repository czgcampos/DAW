      <h1>42. The Counsel</h1>
      <h2>42. The Counsel</h2>
      <p>Ha Mim.</p>
      <p>Ain Sin Qaf.</p>
      <p>Thus does Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal to you, and (thus He revealed) to those
         before you.
      </p>
      <p>His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He is the High, the Great.</p>
      <p>The heavens may almost rend asunder from above them and the angels sing the praise
         of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth; now surely Allah is the Forgiving,
         the Merciful.
      </p>
      <p>And (as for) those who take guardians besides Him, Allah watches over them, and you
         have not charge over them.
      </p>
      <p>And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Quran, that you may warn the mother city
         and those around it, and that you may give warning of the day of gathering together
         wherein is no doubt; a party shall be in the garden and (another) party in the burning
         fire.
      </p>
      <p>And if Allah had pleased He would surely have made them a single community, but He
         makes whom He pleases enter into His mercy, and the unjust it is that shall have no
         guardian or helper.
      </p>
      <p>Or have they taken guardians besides Him? But Allah is the Guardian, and He gives
         life to the dead, and He has power over all things.
      </p>
      <p>And in whatever thing you disagree, the judgment thereof is (in) Allah's (hand); that
         is Allah, my Lord, on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn time after time.
      </p>
      <p>The Originator of the heavens and the earth; He made mates for you from among yourselves,
         and mates of the cattle too, multiplying you thereby; nothing like a likeness of Him;
         and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
      </p>
      <p>His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; He makes ample and straitens the
         means of subsistence for whom He pleases; surely He is Cognizant of all things.
      </p>
      <p>He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh and that which
         We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that
         keep to obedience and be not divided therein; hard to the unbelievers is that which
         you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself
         him who turns (to Him), frequently.
      </p>
      <p>And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of envy
         among themselves; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed term,
         certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made to
         inherit the Book after them are most surely in disquieting doubt concerning it.
      </p>
      <p>To this then go on inviting, and go on steadfastly on the right way as you are commanded,
         and do not follow their low desires, and say: I believe in what Allah has revealed
         of the Book, and I am commanded to do justice between you: Allah is our Lord and your
         Lord; we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; no plea need there be
         (now) between us and you: Allah will gather us together, and to Him is the return.
      </p>
      <p>And (as for) those who dispute about Allah after that obedience has been rendered
         to Him, their plea is null with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is
         severe punishment.
      </p>
      <p>Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth, and the balance, and what shall make
         you know that haply the hour be nigh?
      </p>
      <p>Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on, and those who believe are in fear
         from it, and they know that it is the truth. Now most surely those who dispute obstinately
         concerning the hour are in a great error.
      </p>
      <p>Allah is Benignant to His servants; He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, and He
         is the Strong, the Mighty.
      </p>
      <p>Whoever desires the gain of the hereafter, We will give him more of that again; and
         whoever desires — the gain of this world, We give him of it, and in the hereafter
         he has no portion.
      </p>
      <p>Or have they associates who have prescribed for them any religion that Allah does
         not sanction? And were it not for the word of judgment, decision would have certainly
         been given between them; and surely the unjust shall have a painful punishment.
      </p>
      <p>You will see the unjust fearing on account of what they have earned, and it must befall
         them; and those who believe and do good shall be in the meadows of the gardens; they
         shall have what they please with their Lord: that is the great grace.
      </p>
      <p>That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, (to) those who believe
         and do good deeds. Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near
         relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah
         is Forgiving, Grateful.
      </p>
      <p>Or do they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? But if Allah pleased, He would
         seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with
         His words; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts.
      </p>
      <p>And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and
         He knows what you do;
      </p>
      <p>And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more out of His
         grace; and (as for) the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment.
      </p>
      <p>And if Allah should amplify the provision for His servants they would certainly revolt
         in the earth; but He sends it down according to a measure as He pleases; surely He
         is Aware of, Seeing, His servants.
      </p>
      <p>And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His
         mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praised One.
      </p>
      <p>And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has
         spread forth in both of them of living beings; and when He pleases He is all-powerful
         to gather them together.
      </p>
      <p>And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought,
         and (yet) He pardons most (of your faults).
      </p>
      <p>And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper
         besides Allah.
      </p>
      <p>And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains.</p>
      <p>If He pleases, He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its
         back; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one,
      </p>
      <p>Or He may make them founder for what they have earned, and (even then) pardon most;</p>
      <p>And (that) those who dispute about Our communications may know; there is no place
         of refuge for them.
      </p>
      <p>So whatever thing you are given, that is only a provision of this world's life, and
         what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on their
         Lord.
      </p>
      <p>And those who. shun the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they
         forgive.
      </p>
      <p>And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer, and their rule is to take
         counsel among themselves, and who spend out of what We have given them.
      </p>
      <p>And those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend themselves.</p>
      <p>And the recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends,
         he shall have his reward from Allah; surely He does not love the unjust.
      </p>
      <p>And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed, these it is against whom there
         is no way (to blame).
      </p>
      <p>The way (to blame) is only against those who oppress men and revolt in the earth unjustly;
         these shall have a painful punishment.
      </p>
      <p>And whoever is patient and forgiving, these most surely are actions due to courage.</p>
      <p>And whomsoever Allah makes err, he has no guardian after Him; and you shall see the
         unjust, when they see the punishment, saying: Is there any way to return?
      </p>
      <p>And you shall see them brought before it humbling themselves because of the abasements,
         looking with a faint glance. And those who believe shall say: Surely the losers are
         they who have lost themselves and their followers on the resurrection day. Now surely
         the iniquitous shall remain in lasting chastisement.
      </p>
      <p>And they shall have no friends to help them besides Allah; and — whomsoever Allah
         makes err, he shall have no way.
      </p>
      <p>Hearken to your Lord before there comes the day from Allah for which there shall be
         no averting; you shall have no refuge on that day, nor shall it be yours to make a
         denial.
      </p>
      <p>But if they turn aside, We have not sent you as a watcher over them; on you is only
         to deliver (the message); and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices
         thereat; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already
         done, then-surely man is ungrateful.
      </p>
      <p>Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He pleases; He
         grants to whom He pleases daughters and grants to whom He pleases sons.
      </p>
      <p>Or He makes them of both sorts, male and female; and He makes whom He pleases barren;
         surely He is the Knowing, the Powerful.
      </p>
      <p>And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to them, they could not bear
         to hear and they did not see.
      </p>
      <p>And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our command. You did not know what
         the Book was, nor (what) the faith (was), but We made it a light, guiding thereby
         whom We please of Our servants; and most surely you show the way to the right path:
      </p>
      <p>The path of Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the
         earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come.
