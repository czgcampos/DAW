      <h1>36. Ya Seen</h1>
      <h2>36. Ya Seen</h2>
      <p>Ya Seen.</p>
      <p>I swear by the Quran full of wisdom;</p>
      <p>Most surely you are one of the apostles,</p>
      <p>On a right way.</p>
      <p>A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful.</p>
      <p>That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless.</p>
      <p>Certainly the word has proved true of most of them, so they do not believe.</p>
      <p>Surely We have placed chains on their necks, and these reach up to their chins, so
         they have their heads raised aloft.
      </p>
      <p>And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered
         them over so that they do not see.
      </p>
      <p>And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn them not: they do not believe.</p>
      <p>You can only warn him who follows the reminder and fears the Beneficent God in secret;
         so announce to him forgiveness and an honorable reward.
      </p>
      <p>Surely We give life to the dead, and We write down what they have sent before and
         their footprints, and We have recorded everything in a clear writing.
      </p>
      <p>And set out to them an example of the people of the town, when the messengers came
         to it.
      </p>
      <p>When We sent to them two, they rejected both of them, then We strengthened (them)
         with a third, so they said: Surely we are messengers to you.
      </p>
      <p>They said: You are naught but mortals like ourselves, nor has the Beneficent God revealed
         anything; you only lie.
      </p>
      <p>They said: Our Lord knows that we are most surely messengers to you.</p>
      <p>And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance (of the message).</p>
      <p>They said: Surely we augur evil from you; if you do not desist, we will certainly
         stone you, and there shall certainly afflict you a painful chastisement from us.
      </p>
      <p>They said: Your evil fortune is with you; what! if you are reminded! Nay, you are
         an extravagant people.
      </p>
      <p>And from the remote part of the city there came a man running, he said: O my people!
         follow the messengers;
      </p>
      <p>Follow him who does not ask you for reward, and they are the followers of the right
         course;
      </p>
      <p>And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence?
         And to Him you shall be brought back;
      </p>
      <p>What! shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, If the Beneficent God should
         desire to afflict me with a harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able
         to deliver me?
      </p>
      <p>In that case I shall most surely be in clear error:</p>
      <p>Surely I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me.</p>
      <p>It was said: Enter the garden. He said: O would that my people had known</p>
      <p>Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored ones!</p>
      <p>And We did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We
         ever send down.
      </p>
      <p>It was naught but a single cry, and lo! they were still.</p>
      <p>Alas for the servants! there comes not to them an apostle but they mock at him.</p>
      <p>Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because
         they do not turn to them?
      </p>
      <p>And all of them shall surely be brought before Us.</p>
      <p>And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain
         so they eat of it.
      </p>
      <p>And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth
         in it,
      </p>
      <p>That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they
         not then be grateful?
      </p>
      <p>Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their
         kind and of what they do not know.
      </p>
      <p>And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! they are
         in the dark;
      </p>
      <p>And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty,
         the Knowing.
      </p>
      <p>And (as for) the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an
         old dry palm branch.
      </p>
      <p>Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night
         outstrip the day; and all float on in a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship.</p>
      <p>And We have created for them the like of it, what they will ride on.</p>
      <p>And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no succorer for them, nor
         shall they be rescued,
      </p>
      <p>But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time.</p>
      <p>And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before you and what is behind you,
         that mercy may be had on you.
      </p>
      <p>And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but
         they turn aside from it.
      </p>
      <p>And when it is said to them: Spend out of what Allah has given you, those who disbelieve
         say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed?
         You are in naught but clear error.
      </p>
      <p>And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?</p>
      <p>They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend
         with one another.
      </p>
      <p>So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families.</p>
      <p>And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! from their graves they shall hasten on to
         their Lord.
      </p>
      <p>They shall say: O woe to us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is
         what the Beneficent God promised and the apostles told the truth.
      </p>
      <p>There would be naught but a single cry, when lo! they shall all be brought before
         Us;
      </p>
      <p>So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be
         rewarded aught but that which you did.
      </p>
      <p>Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy.</p>
      <p>They and their wives shall be in shades, reclining on raised couches.</p>
      <p>They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire.</p>
      <p>Peace: a word from a Merciful Lord.</p>
      <p>And get aside today, O guilty ones!</p>
      <p>Did I not charge you, O children of Adam! that you should not serve the Shaitan? Surely
         he is your open enemy,
      </p>
      <p>And that you should serve Me; this is the right way.</p>
      <p>And certainly he led astray numerous people from among you. What! could you not then
         understand?
      </p>
      <p>This is the hell with which you were threatened.</p>
      <p>Enter into it this day because you disbelieved.</p>
      <p>On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us,
         and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.
      </p>
      <p>And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about
         groping for the way, but how should they see?
      </p>
      <p>And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not
         be able to go on, nor will they return.
      </p>
      <p>And whomsoever We cause to live long, We reduce (him) to an abject state in constitution;
         do they not then understand?
      </p>
      <p>And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it meet for him; it is nothing but a reminder
         and a plain Quran,
      </p>
      <p>That it may warn him who would have life, and (that) the word may prove true against
         the unbelievers.
      </p>
      <p>Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of what Our hands have wrought,
         so they are their masters?
      </p>
      <p>And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they have to ride upon, and some
         of them they eat.
      </p>
      <p>And therein they have advantages and drinks; will they not then be grateful?</p>
      <p>And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped.</p>
      <p>(But) they shall not be able to assist them, and they shall be a host brought up before
         them.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and
         what they do openly.
      </p>
      <p>Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed? Then lo! he is an open
         disputant.
      </p>
      <p>And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he: Who will
         give life to the bones when they are rotten?
      </p>
      <p>Say: He will give life to them Who brought them into existence at first, and He is
         Cognizant of all creation,
      </p>
      <p>He Who has made for you the fire (to burn) from the green tree, so that with it you
         kindle (fire).
      </p>
      <p>Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yea!
         and He is the Creator (of all), the Knower.
      </p>
      <p>His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.</p>
      <p>Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and to Him you
         shall be brought back.
