      <h1>89. The Daybreak</h1>
      <h2>89. The Daybreak</h2>
      <p>I swear by the daybreak,</p>
      <p>And the ten nights,</p>
      <p>And the even and the odd,</p>
      <p>And the night when it departs.</p>
      <p>Truly in that there is an oath for those who possess understanding.</p>
      <p>Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Ad,</p>
      <p>(The people of) Aram, possessors of lofty buildings,</p>
      <p>The like of which were not created in the (other) cities;</p>
      <p>And (with) Samood, who hewed out the rocks in the valley,</p>
      <p>And (with) Firon, the lord of hosts,</p>
      <p>Who committed inordinacy in the cities,</p>
      <p>So they made great mischief therein?</p>
      <p>Therefore your Lord let down upon them a portion of the chastisement.</p>
      <p>Most surely your Lord is watching.</p>
      <p>And as for man, when his Lord tries him, then treats him with honor and makes him
         lead an easy life, he says: My Lord honors me.
      </p>
      <p>But when He tries him (differently), then straitens to him his means of subsistence,
         he says: My Lord has disgraced me.
      </p>
      <p>Nay! but you do not honor the orphan,</p>
      <p>Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor,</p>
      <p>And you eat away the heritage, devouring (everything) indiscriminately,</p>
      <p>And you love wealth with exceeding love.</p>
      <p>Nay! when the earth is made to crumble to pieces,</p>
      <p>And your Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks,</p>
      <p>And hell is made to appear on that day. On that day shall man be mindful, and what
         shall being mindful (then) avail him?
      </p>
      <p>He shall say: O! would that I had sent before for (this) my life!</p>
      <p>But on that day shall no one chastise with (anything like) His chastisement,</p>
      <p>And no one shall bind with (anything like) His binding.</p>
      <p>O soul that art at rest!</p>
      <p>Return to your Lord, well-pleased (with him), well-pleasing (Him),</p>
      <p>So enter among My servants,</p>
      <p>And enter into My garden.</p>
